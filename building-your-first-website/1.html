    <h2>It all began...</h2>
    <p id="art1"> in September 1963, the x-men were introduced. For the next 60 years they would go on to dominate the
        world of comics. Their story, unlike so many other
        super-hero tales, seems like it's plucked from the future rather than fantasy. While other superheroes were
        touched by gods, the x-men were touched by the scientific feat of evolution. SOmething something and something.
    </p>

    <h2>The Story</h2>

    <p>They are children of the atom, homo superior, the next link in the chain of evolution. Each was born with a
        unique genetic mutation, which at puberty manifested itself in extraordinary powers. In a world filled with hate
        and prejudice, they are feared by those who cannot accept their differences. Led by Xavier the X-Men fight to
        protect a world that fears them. They are locked in a battle with former colleague and friend, Magneto who
        believes humans and mutants should never co-exist.</p>
